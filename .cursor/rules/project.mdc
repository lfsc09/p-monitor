# About

This Go project's objective is to make a .deb for linux that monitors performance of my machine, running in background to gather the following information:
- The disk total capacity and used space in percentage.
- The memory total capacity and usage in percentage.
- The total CPU usage in percentage and it's temperature.
- The GPU usage in percentage and temperature. (It must gather both integrated [if available] GPU and dedicated [if available] GPU)
  - Dedicated GPU must check and consider both AMD and Nvidia.

The program when running, should not appear in the Dock (Side bar) like regular programs, it should only show an icon in the desktop Top bar where it will show:
- The gathered information in each "line" using available icons from `/assets` to better differentiate resources.
- A number input so the user can change the time between reads, and where he can choose between "seconds" and "minutes". (Ex.: 5 seconds, 1 minute, 15 minutes)
- An input so the user can choose between Celcius or Fahrenheit temperature.

# Logging

The program should should log to `~/.p-monitor/logs`.

# Structure

Project assets will be located at `/assets` (Ex.: icons).
A simple architeture to separate data gather from data display will be followed, so they should be in separate packages.
